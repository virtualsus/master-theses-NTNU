%Proof of concept (PoC) is a realization of a certain method or idea in order to demonstrate its feasibility

The concept of this study was to examine an idea about using Leap Motion and hand-free gesture interaction in order to measure motor performance in children. This was a prove of principle kind of approach where the specific idea was checked for its feasibility. Thus, the goal was to investigate the feasibility of using Leap Motion controller to extract motor performance parameters. Since there is only few research in this field, the value of project was significant.

The study demonstrated that it is possible to extract motor performance parameters, such as time and accuracy, from a Leap Motion driven computer game.

%what is left out, yet to-do

Due to the limited time scope of this study, many interesting points needed to be left out. Additionally, the information gained during the study are a great start point for further exploration and research.
